# Stargazers (Cosmic Crescendo)
## A Mobile App of our project for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024
### Description of Challenge and Stargazers Project
1) **Challenge Name:**  Symphony of the Stars: Harmonizing the James Webb Space Telescope in Music and Images
2) **Challenge Description:** Create a project to capture the spirit of this remarkable mission by creating a collage that merges stunning JWST visuals with a compelling musical backdrop, encapsulating the sense of discovery and cosmic awe that the telescope inspires in a way that appeals to people of all ages.
3) **Project Desctiption:** We have developed a web interface and an android app that informs users about astronomical objects and applies a transformation on images to make sound. We used many techniques like image processing, data sonification, image segmentation, front-end and android app development. We mapped attributes of colors to music notes and tried to have a harmonic sound. *The aim of the project is to make space sound using space images and inform users about the space objects interactively.*

  **This repo only contains our mobile app codes.**

### App Features
Our app begins with an engaging storytelling animation designed to spark users' curiosity about space. Following the animation, users can explore a selection of stunning JWST images and learn detailed information about each one. Additionally, users can interact with the images by touching the screen, creating an immersive experience that allows them to "feel" the environment through the algorithm that turns space images into sound.
